Flight simulator scripts
========================

Different scripts for handling flight simulator (in my case Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020) and related utility/add-on tools.

The scripts require [AutoIt](https://www.autoitscript.com/). Just install it and now you can double-click on `.au3` files in order to run them.

You will normally not be able to use my scripts out-of-the-box - you will first need to adapt them for your setup though - change file paths, change programs you want to start, timeouts, etc. But the scripts are written so that they are self-explanatory and you don't need to be a programmer in order to tweak them!
