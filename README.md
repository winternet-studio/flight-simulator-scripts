Flight simulator scripts
========================

Different scripts for handling flight simulator (in my case Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020) and related utility/add-on tools.

The scripts require [AutoIt](https://www.autoitscript.com/). Just install it and now you can double-click on the .au3 file in order to run it.

The scripts are written so that they are self-explanatory and you don't need to be a programmer in order to tweak them.
